                        email with a tracking number. You can use this number 
                        to track your order on our website under the "Track 
                        Order" section. If you experience any issues,

                        We offer a hassle-free return policy within 30 days
                        of purchase, provided the item is unused and in its 
                        original packaging. Once we receive and inspect 
                        the returned item, we will process your refund 
                        within 5-7 business days. Refunds will be credited 
                        to your original payment method.

                        apply depending on your country’s regulations.

                    <div class="answer5">
                        Orders can be modified or canceled within 1 hour of 
                        placement by contacting our support team. After this
                        period, orders are processed and shipped, making 
                        cancellations difficult. If your order has already 
                        shipped, you can request a return once you receive
                        the item.
